In 2016, the estimated number of dinosaur species that existed in the Mesozoic was 1,543â€“2,468.[22][23] 
In 2021, the number of modern-day birds (avian dinosaurs) was estimated to be at 10,806 species.[24] 
Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous, including seed-eaters, fish-eaters, insectivores, and omnivores. 
While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are all modern birds), some prehistoric species were quadrupeds, 
and others, such as Anchisaurus and Iguanodon, could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Cranial modifications
like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had bony armor. 
Although known for large size, many Mesozoic dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller, and modern birds are generally 
small in size. Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution 
by at least the Early Jurassic epoch.[25] Modern birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine,
and there is evidence that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as Microraptor) could fly or at least glide, and others,
such as spinosaurids, had semiaquatic habits.[26]

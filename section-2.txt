Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic Era, 
especially the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. 
Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches; mammals, 
for example, rarely exceeded the size of a domestic cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey.
[17] They have always been recognized as an extremely varied group of animals; 
over 900 non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty as of 2018, 
and the total number of genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around 1850, 
nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered, and 1124 species by 2016.
[18][19][20] A 1995 study predicted that about 3,400 dinosaur genera ever existed, 
including many that would not have been preserved in the fossil record.[21]
